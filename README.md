## Not using Docker

(Make sure you have hardhat installed. If not: cd backend < "npm install --save-dev hardhat")
1. Run IPFS node 
2. cd backend < npx hardhat compile < npx hardhat node and, in a seperate powershell: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_all.js --network localhost
3. cd client < npm run start

# Eth Gas Reporter
cd backend < npx hardhat test

**To be correctly executed:**
1. It was necessary to install: npm install –save-dev eth-gas-reporter and add a configuration in the hardhat.config.js.
    1.1. It is necesary to create an account in: https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/account/ and get the API key 
    1.2. Create a .env file and past: COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY="{your_api_key}" 
2. To **generate report** uncomment lines in hardhat.config.js.

In this report, only transactions are ilustrated, this is, get methods aren't because they don't use gas.

# Test Coverage

## Front-end 
cd client < npm test 
cd client < npx jest --coverage => to run with test coverage ( a folder called coverage is created. Open in chrome file: "index.html")

## Back-end
cd backend < npx hardhat test < npx hardhat coverage => a folder called "coverage" is generated. Open index.html in browser

1. If you're using IPFS Desktop App:
